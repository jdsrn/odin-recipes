<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>Pad thai is one of my favorite dishes to make. After trying many different recipes over the years, I have finally stumbled the one that is by far the best. I've tweaked it a bit and have come up with a nine-step dish that is layered, authentic, and affordable!</p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cardamom Shortbread: 657 g salted butter, softened; 180 g powdered/icing/confectioners' sugar; 3 tsp ground cardamom; 756 g all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Orange Glaze: 360 g confectioners' sugar; 3 tbsp orange juice; 3 tbsp milk; orange zest to decorate.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Equipment</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li>Electric mixer; plastic wrap; parchment paper; rolling pin; cookie cutter; baking sheets; plates; cooling rack.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
<ol>
    <li>Beat butter and sugar on low speed until incorporated. Increase to medium speed and continue to beat until creamed (about 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Add flour and cardamom. Mix on low speed until dough comes together in medium-sized chunks and you don't see flour streaks in bowl. Do not overmix.</li>
    <li>Press dough together with your hands and a spatula. Turn the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Use plastic wrap to shape dough into disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Unwrap dough. Place between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll 1/2-inch thick. Cut out with cookie cutter. Line baking sheets or plates with parchment paper, place cookies on, put in freezer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°F and transfer cookies to baking sheets, if not on already. Bake for 41 minutes, or until very lightly golden. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Move cookies to cooling rack.</li>
    <li>Once cookies have cooled, mix together sugar, orange juice, and milk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Dip cookies. Sprinkle with zest. Set on plate or cooling rack until set.</li>
